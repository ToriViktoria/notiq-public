**Notiq — Smart Voice Notes with Offline AI and Total Privacy**

Notiq is your intelligent voice notebook — designed for people who value privacy, clarity, and focus.  
It transforms spoken words into organized notes and to-do lists with the help of on-device AI, without ever connecting to the cloud.

Everything in Notiq happens locally on your iPhone: speech recognition, transcription, and note creation.  
You can record ideas, meetings, and thoughts anywhere — even without an internet connection.  
Each note is instantly transcribed into text, structured automatically, and stored with AES-256 encryption for maximum protection.

Unlike typical voice recorders or online transcription tools, Notiq never uploads or shares your data.  
It’s a productivity tool built entirely around privacy — smart, elegant, and secure by design.

## 🔐 Privacy by Design

Privacy isn’t a feature — it’s the foundation.  
Notiq never sends audio or text to external servers.  
All AI models run directly on your device, and all data is encrypted using AES-256 before storage.  
You don’t need an account, and nothing is ever synced or backed up online.  

Your voice, your notes, your control.

Built natively for iOS with **SwiftUI** and **on-device AI frameworks**.  
Notiq uses optimized neural speech recognition for fast, accurate offline transcription, even during long recordings.  
Every operation — from recognizing speech to creating structured to-dos — runs locally, so performance remains fast and private.
